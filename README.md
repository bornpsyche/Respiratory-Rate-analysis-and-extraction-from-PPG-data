**Empirical mode decomposition (EMD)** and its noise-assisted variants are widely used for decomposing non-linear and non-stationary signals. 
An **EMD-PCA** based hybrid model was developed to extract RR from PPG. 
The performance of each model has been tested using two different datasets: **BIDMC and Capnobase**.
